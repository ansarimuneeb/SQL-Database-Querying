The focus of this project was to utilize different joins (right, left, full, inner) to combine different tables to form an Analytical Base Table (ATB) which becomes the basis of further data cleaning, data manipulation and analysis.

The analysis revolved around determining what kind of insurance policy was bought most by people with respect to their demographic data.

Conclusion:

"Knowing the characteristics of customers that opt for certain insurance products can be very helpful in 
terms of creating highly focused marketing communications for them. For the case of life insurance 
products, customer satisfaction and trust were the factors that lead to the highest purchase intention 
(Panigrahi, Azizan and Waris, 2018). Focusing marketing communications on these aspects can help 
build brand value in return.
Demographic factors like age and gender also have an affect on how likely it is for a vehicle insurance to 
be claimed which is associated with the risk of an unfortunate event (Bian et al., 2018). Hence to 
reduce the risk of dangerous driving, there has been an attempt to create a new model for motor 
insurance pricing policy called pay-how-you-drive (Guillen, Nielsen and Pérez‐Marín, 2021) which 
penalizes the customer if they drive recklessly.
Before considering factors that affect consumer intentions to purchase travel insurances, we need to 
acknowledge the changing behavior of travel post COVID-19 due to increased fear of health hazards and 
risks at tourist destinations (Petrus, Yahya and Yahya, 2022). If a traveler has a history of traveling very 
often, they are more likely to purchase travel insurances which also depends on whether those travels 
were local or international (Dai, 2023)."
